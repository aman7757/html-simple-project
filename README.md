## 🚀 Why I Made This

This repo marks the **beginning of my Full Stack Web Development journey**.  
I started with pure HTML and will keep expanding this project as I learn new technologies like:

- 🎨 **CSS** — for styling and layout
- 🧠 **JavaScript** — to add interactivity
- ⚛️ **React** — for building component-based UIs
- 🛠️ **Node.js / Spring Boot** — for backend development
- 🗃️ **MongoDB / SQL** — for databases
- 🌐 **REST APIs** — for real-world integration

The plan is to upgrade this static HTML project as I grow — into interactive, styled, and full-stack applications.

## ✨ Features

- Uses **almost all basic and semantic HTML tags**
- Beginner-friendly and clean code
- Easy to understand and replicate
- Fully open-source and made for learners
